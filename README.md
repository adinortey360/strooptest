Stroop Test
-----------

Stroop Test is a simple JavaScript application built with Electron JS that uses the SpeechRecognition Web API to test a user's ability to focus and concentrate.

To use the application, simply clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Then, run `npm start` to launch the application.

Once the application is open, you will be presented with a series of words that are displayed in different colors. Your task is to identify the color of the text, not the word itself. This can be challenging because the text and the color may not match. For example, the word "red" may be displayed in blue font.

The test will measure how quickly and accurately you are able to identify the colors of the words. At the end of the test, you will be given a score based on your performance. This score can be used as a general indication of your ability to focus and concentrate.


How to setup
-----------

To use Stroop Test, you will need a computer with the latest version of Node.js and npm installed. You will also need an internet connection to access the SpeechRecognition Web API.


To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the root directory of the project. Then, run the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:

`npm install`

Once all of the dependencies have been installed, you can launch the application by running:

`npm start`

The application will open in a new window, and you can begin the Stroop Test by following the on-screen instructions.


If you have any questions or suggestions for improving the application, please feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository. I would welcome all contributions and feedback.
